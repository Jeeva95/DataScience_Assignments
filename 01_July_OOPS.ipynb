    "\n",
    "**1. Robustness**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every good programmer wants to produce software that is correct, which means that a program produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program’s application. In addition, we want the software to be robust, that is, capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Adaptability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern software projects, such as word processors, web browsers, and Internet Search engines, typically involve large programs that are expected to last for many years. Therefore, software needs to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reusability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Going hand in hand with adaptability is the desire that software is reusable, that is, code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications. Developing quality software can be an expensive enterprise, and its cost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easily reusable in future applications. Such reuse should be done with care, however. "

    "Inheritance is the concept in OOPs in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the **Parent class**. And the class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the **Child class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance provides code reusability, abstraction, etc. Because of inheritance, we can even inherit abstract classes, classes with constructors, etc. For example – Beagle, Pitbull, etc., are different breeds of dogs, so they all have inherited the properties of class dog.\n",

    "**Benefits of inheritance are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "- It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "- Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. \n",
    "- Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance. "

This enables code reusability of a parent class, and adding new features to a class makes code more readable, elegant and less redundant. And thus, single inheritance is much more safer than multiple inheritances if it’s done in the right way and enables derived class to call parent class method and also to override parent classe’s existing methods."
